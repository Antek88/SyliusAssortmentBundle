It provides basic CRUD interface for product model.
The goal was to have many extension points.

About project "Sylius".
-----------------------

I've created a set of bundles from which you can create a fully featured e-commerce platform.
Now I'm working on a bundle that will integrate them into one, rich e-commerce system, that will fit the needs of end user, but also will be friendly for developers.
All is based on Symfony2.
Most of the bundles are in useable stage, actually there are 2 online shops built on Sylius bundles that run in production.
The work is focused now on bundle that provide plugins system with web interface, and a theming bundle.

**Please note!** I know that many of this bundles are far from being ideal.
I just want to share my work with others and also learn something new.
