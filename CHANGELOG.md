CHANGELOG
=========

### 19-12-2012

* Introduce specs with [phpspec2](http://phpspec.net).
* Simplify the interfaces.
* Bring back variant generation action.
* Fix variant creation.
* Add default entities.
* Use Doctrine RTEL, now you can use the interfaces in mapping
  and the bundle will automatically resolve them to configured classes.
